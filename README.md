# Task Minder
- It's a task storing app, in which we can add our daily task for remembering also maintaing. In this I'm using mostly ReactJs, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUi as a component library for frontend and mongoDB, nodejs and expressJs for backend also. For use this we have login in this system using google or using a email and after this we can add task. To view those task we have to go the all list button ffrom Navbar, in this list we can edit, delete the task also we can mark as a completed a task when a task is completed.
